    <p>What i have done during this quarantine is mostly been playing games. I've grown up with them so they help me pass time while we are stuck mostly inside. I like listening to music, and i do it sometimes when i am doing work. It helps release stress that gets built up inside me from doing a lot of work. I hope this pandemic clears up soon.</p>
